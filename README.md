# Portfolio-Page
  This was my second attempt at creating a portfolio webpage. I wasn't happy with the first one, because it looked like a webpage from the mid 90s.
  So I decided to broaden my web development knowledge and most importantly learn Javascript. Going from C# to JS was pretty tough, because in my opinion C# is like a matured adult, but JS is more like a wild teen, if you know what I mean. I'm mainly talking about the syntax.
