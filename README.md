# <a href="https://flashgt.github.io/Portfolio-Page/" target="_blank">Portfolio-Page</a>
  This is purely a responsive front-end web application. Which I created for one of my University assignments. Just like the title says, it's a portfolio webpage, which displays my projects and has some information about me, currently I'm hosting it using the Github pages, which means that the contact form doesn't work.
