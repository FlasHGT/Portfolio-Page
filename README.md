# Portfolio-Page
  This was my second attempt at creating a portfolio webpage. I wasn't happy with the first one, because it looked like a webpage from the mid 90s.
  So I decided to broaden my web development knowledge and most importantly learn Javascript. Next up on my web development journey is learning a javascript framework, for example, React.
# What I Learned
  <ul>
    <li>The basics of JavaScript</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
  </ul>
